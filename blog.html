                <h3>My First Blog Post: Why I Made This Website and Why You Shouldn't Take Me Too Seriously😅</h3>
                <p class="post-date">January 13, 2026</p>
                <p>So here's the thing: I didn't make this website to become the next tech billionaire or anything fancy (pls make me). Nah pachoychoy lang jud. 
                    Pero bitaw I made it because I got bored one night, thought “hmm, why not? showcase nako mga good pics and little things about me wew” 
                    and suddenly boom I was deep in HTML, CSS, and ctrl+z-ing my life away. 🤓</p>
                <p>Also, I probably look like I've been overworking AI to help me make this… because bobo man tayo. I keep beating AI at 2 AM, thinking I'm productive, 
                    while internally screaming, “Damn, I sleep so early… early in the morning fxck!” 
                    Tinks Tekenolojiya — I've officially gotten really good at prompting. Basically, I'm relying on AI to save my life (and my website). 💻✨</p>
                <p>Basically, this website is my digital playground — a place where I can post random thoughts, show my designs, and confuse people with my weird sense of humor. 
                    Half the time I make things just to see if I can, the other half I'm procrastinating on… life.</p>
                <p>So yeah, that's why I made this. Not for fame, not for fortune (a big lie), but for fun, kay jejemon man ko, and because sometimes creativity really just hits at 2 AM na para bang wakwak ako. 
                    Welcome to my little corner of chaos. Tsarot salamat AI✨</p>

                <h3>Love Life (Unfiltered & Slightly Unhinged)</h3>
                <p class="post-date">January 15, 2026</p>

                <p>
                    I've been single for 18 years di sa daw mag bf— until I had one at 18 pud haha.
                    Back then, I thought maybe I'd just try it since I have a crush on that guy man pud
                    and deal with the consequences later on. But unexpectedly, my mother didn't really mind.
                    She's actually very supportive of me. My inatay. Ina at Tatay haha, yes, technically a
                    'broken family' but to me, it still feels complete. I have the best family.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Back to my first bf, we almost made it to 2 years, but sadly, we broke up because of a
                    certain something. Maybe some of you who are reading this already know, but I won't share
                    the whole story. All I want to say is… I know I can be a red flag sometimes. I can be toxic,
                    too. But when I love, I love genuinely and deeply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After my breakup, there was this guy who keeps showing me affection. Of course, I wasn't
                    fully over my ex at that time. Even then, I kept giving him mixed signals. I admit that was
                    wrong. I did try to remind him of certain things, like how I wasn't ready and how I have an
                    avoidant attachment style chuchu but still, I kept giving signals anyway bo@ng.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He's a good guy, really. There's just something about him that I don't like, maybe it's his
                    attitude. I won't go deep into it, I'll keep it short. What I hated most was how he would
                    say things as if we were together when we weren't (but my fault pa rin ba? since mix signal
                    giver ko?haha). We would have quarrels over small stuff, and we were 'just friends' ra so
                    yeah, still my fault too because of my toxic traits. Amego ra tang tanan lagi.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I kept thinking about the long run: if we fight over small things now (kanang oa ra kaayo
                    although oa pud diay ko gagstok:<<<), what more in the future? I know relationships aren't
                    only about sweetness and happy moments, but fighting over little things really bothered me.
                    It didn't feel good.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was sensitive, nothing wrong with that, our feelings are valid — but I had my reasons.
                    He could be hardheaded, but again, he was a good guy. Still, I eventually stopped
                    communicating with him because natrigger ako of something basta chuchu. I honestly didn't
                    see a future na. You guys might not get it, but I want a man who can 'out-man' me.
                    Mas babae kase sya sakin uy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So mao to I kept telling myself I won't let anyone disturb my inner peace anymore kapoya.
                    I'd rather stay single.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HAHAHAHA. (JOKE TIME RA DIAY Big lies now)
                </p>
                <p>
                    At first, I was in denial that I had a crush on this guy. He gets on my nerves because he
                    'bullies' me (not in a bad way tho), just teasing me with this cringey word (anhi nagsugod
                    tanan). He first messaged me about academics, but later he started teasing me more — his
                    nature, by the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe that was his way of approaching me charot, assuming but honestly, he would message
                    sometimes or reply to my stories just to provoke me. Then the conversation would stop then
                    start again. And since I don't usually reply (kapoy issue), it became this on-and-off thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our conversations were so irregular like after two months, three months, or sometimes
                    weeks rapud… literally like season man HAHAHHAHAAH.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Somewhere along the way (I won't say when), I started liking him but I stayed in denial as
                    I said. I also have this trait where I'd rather admire someone from afar than confess, kay
                    thrilling dae. Inlove gamay, broken dako yabag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I get tired easily man jud when I have someone to entertain (depende), so tiring sig chat uy
                    mosultig goodmorning, nagkaon naka? chuchu so I prefer it that way which is quietly admiring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Until one day, I posted a note on Messenger. He replied to it and honestly, that note was
                    really for him. Destiny? Fate? Akin ka talaga, iwan mo na babae mo, tsar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ever heard of a red string theory? Nakahigot nata hehe ako lang to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So back to it, I replied, he replied back, and we kept going. We teased each other, I teased
                    him back too, and then (as usual) I stopped replying again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But later that night, he posted a myday of him dancing na para bang BADING so I replied to
                    his story making fun of him. One thing led to another, and eventually… we became a thing?
                </p>
                <p>
                    WAAH.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I just thought maybe I should take a risk one last time — who knows what could happen.
                    Basin next year napud mi magchat ug diko moreply nabuang. Amego ra ta tanan except niya ehe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And unexpectedly he likes me too diay abikog sungog rani. Reyal or Fake?!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Awwwee. Are you reading this, love? Char.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No label, guys. We're just getting to know each other more muna until we… (shhh, secret).
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, let me tell you why I admire this guy. He's really flexible and manly (my type heh big
                    boy) — like wow. A working student who can multitask and balance school, work, and home
                    life. Cookerist siya yes daddy material ugh. He's also very independent and responsible.
                    And knows many work unlike me pabigat. Kahibaw syas mga butang and that impresses me a lot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Araw-araw sipag lang theme song mo boy?
                </p>
                <p>
                    And there's one thing I really, really like about him po. His voice ft. guitar vvwala~~.
                    Damn. That genuinely attracts me. You know how to akit me ha.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imbis ayokona, yes i do na nuon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also vibe like birds of a feather flock together grabeha but he's crazier than me lang
                    way makapildi sa kasungogan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And of course, mga dae his 'handsomeness' vwalaa. Like, damn gwapoha da gitarong mani ug
                    buhat sanaol maypag gipisik nalang ko alanganin man ko.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Btw we're still together, bleh. And yes, he has a lot of admirers pud hays as expected sa
                    heartthrob — beautiful girls all around him naibog and here I am, haggard and immature
                    level 100. Gilumay ra koni sya.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's just end this here before my jealousy takes over. (NOT SELOSA PROMISE!)
